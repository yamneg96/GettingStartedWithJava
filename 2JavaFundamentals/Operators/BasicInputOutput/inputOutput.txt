Difference between println(), print() and printf()
print() - It prints string inside the quotes.
println() - It prints string inside the quotes similar like print() method. Then the cursor moves to the beginning of the next line.
printf() - It provides string formatting (similar to printf in C/C++ programming).

Java Input
Java provides different ways to get input from the user. However, in this tutorial, you will learn to get input from user using the object of Scanner class.

In order to use the object of Scanner, we need to import java.util.Scanner package.

import java.util.Scanner;
To learn more about importing packages in Java, visit Java Import Packages.

Then, we need to create an object of the Scanner class. We can use the object to take input from the user.

// create an object of Scanner
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

// take input from the user
int number = input.nextInt();
Example: Get Integer Input From the User
import java.util.Scanner;

class Input {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    	
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    	
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int number = input.nextInt();
        System.out.println("You entered " + number);

        // closing the scanner object
        input.close();
    }
}
Run Code
Output:

Enter an integer: 23
You entered 23
In the above example, we have created an object named input of the Scanner class. We then call the nextInt() method of the Scanner class to get an integer input from the user.

Similarly, we can use nextLong(), nextFloat(), nextDouble(), and next() methods to get long, float, double, and string input respectively from the user.

Note: We have used the close() method to close the object. It is recommended to close the scanner object once the input is taken.
