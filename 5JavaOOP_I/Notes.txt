Important Notes on Java Constructors
Constructors are invoked implicitly when you instantiate objects.

The two rules for creating a constructor are:
1. The name of the constructor should be the same as the class.
2. A Java constructor must not have a return type.

If a class doesn't have a constructor, the Java compiler automatically creates a default constructor during run-time.
The default constructor initializes instance variables with default values. For example, the int variable will be initialized to 0.

Constructor types:
No-Arg Constructor - a constructor that does not accept any arguments
Parameterized constructor - a constructor that accepts arguments
Default Constructor - a constructor that is automatically created by the Java compiler if it is not explicitly defined.

A constructor cannot be abstract or static or final.

A constructor can be overloaded but can not be overridden.
