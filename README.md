# Java Learning Path Ì∫Ä

This repository outlines a comprehensive learning path for Java programming, covering everything from the basics to advanced concepts.

## Introduction to Java ‚òï

* **Get Started With Java** ‚úÖ:  Begin your Java journey with setting up your development environment.
* **Your First Java Program** Ì≥ù: Write and run your first Hello, World! program.
* **Java Comments** Ì≤¨: Learn how to add comments to your code for better readability and understanding.

## Java Fundamentals Ì≤°

* **Java Fundamentals** ‚û°Ô∏è: Dive into the core concepts of Java, including variables, data types, and operators.

## Flow Control Ì¥Ñ

* **Java Flow Control** ‚û°Ô∏è: Master conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) to control the flow of your program.

## Arrays Ì¥¢

* **Java Arrays** ‚û°Ô∏è: Learn how to work with arrays, which are used to store collections of elements of the same data type.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Ì≥¶

* **Java OOP(I)** ‚û°Ô∏è: Understand the basics of OOP, including classes, objects, and encapsulation.
* **Java OOP(II)** ‚û°Ô∏è: Explore inheritance and polymorphism, key concepts in OOP.
* **Java OOP(III)** ‚û°Ô∏è: Delve into abstract classes and interfaces, which are used to define contracts and create flexible designs.

## Exception Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è

* **Java Exception Handling** ‚û°Ô∏è: Learn how to handle runtime errors and exceptions gracefully.

## Collections Framework Ì≥ö

* **Java List** ‚û°Ô∏è: Work with lists, which are ordered collections of elements.
* **Java Queue** ‚û°Ô∏è: Understand queues, which follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
* **Java Map** ‚û°Ô∏è: Learn how to use maps, which store key-value pairs.
* **Java Set** ‚û°Ô∏è: Explore sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements.

## Input/Output (I/O) Ì≤æ

* **Java I/o Streams** ‚û°Ô∏è: Learn how to read and write data using streams.
* **Java Reader/Writer** ‚û°Ô∏è: Work with character-based streams for reading and writing text.

## Additional Topics ‚ûï

* **Java Keywords and Identifiers** Ì¥ë: Understand the reserved words and naming rules in Java.
* **Java Operator Precedence** ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó: Learn the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions.
* **Java Bitwise and Shift Operators** ‚öôÔ∏è: Explore bit-level operations and shifting bits.
* **Java Scanner Class** ‚å®Ô∏è: Learn how to read input from the user using the Scanner class.
* **Java Type Casting** Ì¥Ñ: Understand how to convert variables from one data type to another.
* **Java Wrapper Class** Ì≥¶: Learn about wrapper classes that allow primitive data types to be used as objects.
* **Java autoboxing and unboxing** Ì≥¶‚û°Ô∏è‚ÜîÔ∏è: Understand the automatic conversion between primitive types and their wrapper classes.
* **Java Lambda Expressions** ‚ö°: Explore concise ways to represent anonymous functions.
* **Java Generics** Ì¥Ä: Learn how to create reusable code that can work with different data types.
* **Java File Class** Ì≥Ñ: Learn how to interact with files and directories in Java.
* **Nested Loop in Java** Ì¥ÅÌ¥Å: Understand how to use loops within loops for complex iterations.
* **Java Command-Line Arguments** Ì∂•Ô∏è: Learn how to pass arguments to your Java programs from the command line.
